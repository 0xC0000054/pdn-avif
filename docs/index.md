## Welcome to the pdn-avif project site


This project is a [Paint.NET](http://www.getpaint.net) filetype plugin that allows AVIF images to be loaded and saved with transparency.

### The plugin is bundled with Paint.NET 4.2.14 and later.

If you need the features from a newer version you can still install the plugin.   
The plugin will override the bundled version if it has higher version number.
